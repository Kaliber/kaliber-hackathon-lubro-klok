# Lubro Word Clock

Introducing a clock that seamlessly combines function and artistry into one captivating creation – the Lubro Word Clock. This bespoke word clock employs RGB LEDs to transform time-telling into an entrancing visual experience. The clock is driven by the ESP8266 microcontroller, a versatile Wi-Fi-enabled powerhouse. Programming this clock is made possible through the WLED library, offering complete command over the RGB LEDs and a wide spectrum of dynamic effects and animations. With the power of this library, you have the freedom to fully personalize the clock to align with your unique style and preferences. Beyond its utilitarian purpose, the Lubro Word Clock stands as a cutting-edge masterpiece that's bound to make a lasting impression.

## Configuration and Customization

To finely adjust and tailor the clock's behavior, refer to the `platformio_override.ini.sample` file located within the current folder. For any modifications to the usermod, specifically in the case of an ESP8266, remember to duplicate this file into the project's root directory.

## Safeguarding Your Preferences

During adventurous explorations or experimental tweaks, rely on the guardians of your preferences – `wled_cfg.json` and `wled_presets.json`. These backup files diligently retain your current clock configuration, ensuring that your personalized settings and presets remain intact.
